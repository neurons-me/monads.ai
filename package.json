  "description": "Lisa is a hybrid AI system that combines the power of the cloud with the flexibility of P2P technology. It is designed to be able to recognize users in a centralized way, using a cloud-based hub, and in a decentralized way, using P2P connections between personal devices. Lisa is able to combine these different recognition mechanisms to provide an overall recognition of users in the network, and to personalize the user experience accordingly. With Lisa, you can build intelligent applications that are able to adapt to the needs and preferences of their users, and that are able to scale up and down as needed.",
